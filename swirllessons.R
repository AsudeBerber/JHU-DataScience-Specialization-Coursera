k-means method "aims to partition the points into
| k groups such that the sum of squares from points to the assigned cluster centres
| is minimized."
#k-means clustering requires some distance metric (say Euclidean)
#R function tapply which applies "a function over a ragged array".
#| This means that every element of the array is assigned a factor and the function is
#| applied to subsets of the array (identified by the factor vector). This allows us
#| to take advantage of the factor vector newClust we calculated.
