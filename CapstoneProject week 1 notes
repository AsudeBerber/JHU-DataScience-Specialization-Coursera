Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. 
It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate speech. It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic (i.e. statistical and, most recently, neural network-based) machine learning approaches. 
"Understanding the concept"

Task 0 - Understanding the problem 
- Text mining (reading list) 

Tasks to accomplish
Obtaining the data - Can you download the data and load/manipulate it in R?
Familiarizing yourself with NLP and text mining - Learn about the basics of natural language processing and how it relates to the data science process you have learned in the Data Science Specialization.

Questions to consider
What do the data look like?
Where do the data come from?
Can you think of any other data sources that might help you in this project?
What are the common steps in natural language processing?
What are some common issues in the analysis of text data?
What is the relationship between NLP and the concepts you have learned in the Specialization?


Task 1 - Getting and cleaning the data
