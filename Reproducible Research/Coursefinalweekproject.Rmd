## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

#Data Processing 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("/Users/asudeberber/Downloads/repdata_data_StormData.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(data)
dim(data)
```

#Based on the information above, the data table now has 902,297 rows and 7 columns. Below is a brief description of each variable.

#1. evtype : storm event type #2. fatalities: amount of fatalities per event #3. injuries : amount of injuries per event #4. propdmg : property damage amount #5. propdmgexp: property damage in exponents #6. cropdmg : crop damage amount #7. cropdmgexp: crop damage in exponents


```{r}

```

#There are a lot of columns and I don't need all so I subset them

```{r}
data2 <- data %>% 
 select(c("EVTYPE","FATALITIES","INJURIES","PROPDMG","PROPDMGEXP","CROPDMG","CROPDMGEXP")) %>%
 rename_all(tolower)
str(data2)
```

```{r}
length(unique(data2$EVTYPE))
```

#I select columns I need for the bar plot, group it by event type and calculate sum of both fatalities and injuries. Then, arrange it in descending order and slice the first 10 rows, then gather it and turning it into categorical variables for creating a grouped bar plot.

```{r}
pop_health <-
  data2 %>% select(evtype, fatalities, injuries) %>% 
  group_by(evtype) %>% 
  summarize(fatalities = sum(fatalities), injuries = sum(injuries),.groups='drop') %>%
arrange(desc(fatalities), desc(injuries)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  gather(key = type, value = value, fatalities, injuries)
```

#the variable PROPDMGEXP is regarding property damage expenses, use for economic consequensequences unique(data2$propdmgexp) unique(data2$cropdmgexp)

```{r}
cost <- function(x) {
  if (x == "H")
    1E-4
  else if (x == "K")
    1E-3
  else if (x == "M")
    1
  else if (x == "B")
    1E3
  else
    1-6
}
```

```{r}
economic <-
  data2 %>% select("evtype", "propdmg", "propdmgexp", "cropdmg", "cropdmgexp") %>% 
  mutate(prop_dmg = propdmg*sapply(propdmgexp, FUN = cost), crop_dmg = cropdmg*sapply(cropdmgexp, FUN = cost), .keep="unused") %>%
  group_by(evtype) %>% 
  summarize(property = sum(prop_dmg), crop = sum(crop_dmg), .groups='drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(property), desc(crop)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  gather(key = type, value = value, property, crop)
```

#Results \### First question - 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

```{r}
ggplot(data=pop_health, aes(reorder(evtype, -value), value, fill=type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat="identity") + 
  labs(x="Event Type", y="Count") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20, vjust=0.7)) + 
  ggtitle("Total Number of Fatalities and Injuries of top 10 storm event types") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "pink"))
```

#Based on the bar plot, it can be seen that tornadoes have the highest impact on the popoulation health, since it causes the most fatalities and injuries.

### Second question - 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

```{r}
ggplot(data=economic, aes(reorder(evtype, -value), value, fill=type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat="identity") + 
  labs(x="Event Type", y="Count (millions)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust=0.5)) + 
  ggtitle("Total Cost of Property and Crop Damage by top 10 storm event types") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("darkgreen", "grey"))
```

#From the bar plot, Floods and Hurricanes/Typhoons have highest property and crop damage costs, thus resulting in the biggest economic consequences.

# Conclusion

# On the basis of this analysis, funds should be allocated to strengthening infrastructure or early warning systems so as to deal with tornadoes in order to protect people's safety and health. In order to safeguard these assets and crops as much as possible, there should be more funding for innovation in developing better protection systems and infrastructure with a view to preventing damage from hurricanes and typhoons.
